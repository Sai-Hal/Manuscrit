@article{Debeda2016,
abstract = {Piezoelectric materials are of high interest for many applications, e.g. vibrations measurement, active vibration control or vibration-based damage detection in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). In this paper, thin electroded microceramics of piezoelectric material are straightforward fabricated thanks to the association of the screen-printing technology to the sacrificial layer method. After subsequent printing and drying of a stack of sacrificial, Au, PZT and Au layers on a substrate, piezoelectric disks are fired at 900°C and then released from the substrate. Studies of the electromechanical behaviour of these components obviously show the influence of the sacrificial layer composition on their densification and consequently their piezoelectric properties, favourable for detection of vibrations and SHM applications. Moreover, printing process might lead to lower cost of microceramics implementation than traditional ceramic process.},

@article{Kingon1983,
abstract = {The presence of a PbO-rich liquid phase was previously shown to affect the densification of lead zirconate-lead titanate (PZT) ceramics. The present work attempts to quantify the role of this liquid phase. Increasing amounts of PbO-rich liquid phase is shown to increase the rates of densification in the initial and intermediate stages, but lower the final density. This behavior is discussed. In the case of PbO-deficient samples, the amount of the deficiency is shown to affect the densification rate at the final stage.},

@article{Garg1999,
abstract = {The effect of net PbO content (obtained by taking into account the amount of excess PbO added and PbO loss during sintering) on the mechanical and piezoelectric properties of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics has been studied. The samples were prepared by the solid state route using the morphotropic phase boundary composition Pb(Zr0.535[delta]Ti0.465)O3. Excess PbO was also added to the samples in varying amounts from 0-1.0 wt.{\%}. To vary PbO volatility the samples were sintered with and without a PbO rich atmosphere at 1220°C for 2 h. The resulting Pb content as given by x in Pb1+x(Zr0.535Ti0.465)O3+x varied from x=-1.7×10-2 to 1.8×10-2. The sintered density was found to increase with increasing lead content. The precipitation of the second phase believed to be ZrO2 is observed for x=-1.7×10-2. The fracture mode changed from intergranular to transgranular with increasing x. The fracture toughness (KIC) and strength are minimum near x=0 and increase with increasing as well as decreasing x. The maximum values of KIC and strength are 1.45 MPa m1/2 and 90 MPa, respectively, for x=1.8×10-2. The dielectric constant and piezoelectric strain coefficient d33 increased with x.},

@article{Lucat2008,
abstract = {A new process derived from screen-printing technology and based on thick sacrificial layers has been developed in our laboratory for the fabrication of films partially released from the substrate. The sacrificial layer acts as a stable mechanical support during the firing of the active layer and is totally removed after the final thermal treatment of the sample. Fabrication of a copper electrothermal actuator was undertaken to demonstrate the efficiency of this simple, collective and low cost process. Passive components based on this new process include the fabrication of heating resistors, strain gauges and microchannels. Moreover, the process can also be used to facilitate the implementation of piezoelectric devices. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lin2008,
abstract = {Typically, the printing paste consists of vehicles and inorganic powders, in which vehicles refer to solvent, resin and additives and inorganic powders refer to functional powders and glass powders. A variety of functional pastes are prepared depending on printing needs, while rheological behaviors such as the paste liquidity, thixotropy, and viscoelastic properties will influence printing quality. This study is designed to measure the yield stress, thixotropy, and viscosity at different shear rates of commercially available screen-printing pastes and self-prepared pastes by using a rheometer. In addition, it dynamically measures rheological properties such as viscoelastic. This study also involves the discussion over the viscosity change of commercially available pastes at various shear rates to acquire the association between paste liquidity and printing. Also, with the preparation of vehicles and pastes, the study is intended to observe the impact of various fillers on paste rheological behaviors in a steady-state and dynamic rheological test, offering a reference for selection of solution during paste preparation and using the effects of binders and fillers on the system's rheology to control the conditions, e.g. viscosity, thixotropy and viscoelasticity, for preparation of pastes that fit screen-printing requirements. {\textcopyright} 2007.},
